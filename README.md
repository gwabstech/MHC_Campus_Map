# MHC_Campus_Map
a user-friendly Android application that revolutionizes campus navigation.
The app features a scrollable list view and searchable bar, allowing users to easily locate essential places on campus. 
By integrating the Google Maps API, users can quickly access routes from their current location. 
Additionally, I incorporated sustainability features, such as displaying public transportation, bike rack, and water fountain locations, while providing positive reinforcement for eco-friendly transportation choices. 
My future goal is to expand the app's capabilities to include transit information, on-campus services, news and events,
and available jobs, making it a comprehensive resource for students.
